business,"CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 26, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) today issued the following statement regarding the company's management and monitoring of its ash basins:

For more than a century, Duke Energy has provided safe, reliable and affordable electricity to our customers.

Coal-fired power plants produced a good portion of that electricity.

Throughout the past few decades, we have dedicated significant resources to the management and monitoring of our ash basins. We at Duke Energy care deeply about North Carolina and the health and safety of our communities.

We are committed to working with the state of North Carolina, the North Carolina General Assembly, the North Carolina Utilities Commission and all of our federal and state regulators to fully address the events of the past several weeks as well as reach sound, responsible solutions for how we manage coal ash in our state.

As we look forward, we are being guided by our priorities of protecting the health and safety of our communities and safeguarding the environment, while providing reliable, affordable energy to our customers.

Our families and loved ones live in these communities too.

Our future is closely linked to the future of the communities we serve. Drinking water from the Dan River has remained safe and the river has returned to normal water quality levels.

As a company, we are working together on developing and implementing a disciplined, fact-based approach to evaluating long-term solutions for ash basins as quickly and as safely as possible across our sites.

We will continue to pursue a combination of immediate steps and near-term actions that are part of an overall plan that will be fully implemented over the next few years. Each power plant site is unique, and the long-term solutions require analysis of trade-offs, risks and costs.

With the full resources of Duke Energy and the high priority this calls for, we are moving aggressively to update, expand and accelerate our actions:

We have established an internal strategic task force, with deep expertise, to oversee the comprehensive engineering review of every Duke Energy ash basin, as well as to implement near-term actions and develop longer-term solutions systemwide. This team is directly accountable to Lynn Good , Duke Energy's president and chief executive officer.

, and immediate action will be taken to address any identified issues. After securing the required permits, we plan to move ash at three retired plants, accelerate closure of an additional basin, convert to dry ash handling at all remaining facilities in North Carolina and begin dewatering the other retired basins.

and begin dewatering the other retired basins. We have begun preliminary engineering to assess a broad range of potential options for management of our remaining ash basins. We expect to complete this work by the end of 2014.

We are pleased with the progress we are making and are moving forward with the implementation of the near-term actions outlined in a letter we sent to Gov. McCrory and NCDENR on March 12, 2014, including actively pursuing landfill and storage solutions and converting to all dry fly ash handling. The independent engineering review is under way.

Ash management is an energy industry issue that will be impacted by upcoming EPA regulations, some of which are expected in December 2014. We have dedicated teams in place ready to respond to any new or updated regulations.

Our work will continue with all stakeholders, including federal and state regulators, to find solutions that position North Carolina and the other states we serve for the future.

Duke Energy has a long and proud history in North Carolina. We have 13,000 employees and thousands of contractors throughout the state and provide energy that fuels homes and businesses. We are proud of what we do for North Carolina and we will uphold our commitments to the state.

Thailand's space agency says a satellite has detected up to 300 floating objects in an area of the southern Indian Ocean where the missing Malaysian passenger plane is thought to have vanished.

The objects are reported to have been up to 15m in size. A French satellite had previously spotted about 120 objects that could be from the missing flight.

MH370 disappeared on 8 March with 239 people on board. No debris has been recovered from the ocean so far.

Searches by planes were suspended on Thursday because of poor visibility.

March 27 (Bloomberg) â€” Thai satellite images of more than 300 objects in the south Indian Ocean produced another lead in the hunt for Malaysian Air Flight 370, with Japanese spacecraft also locating items as bad weather halted an airborne search.

The Thai photos from March 24 show objects spanning 2 meters to 15 meters floating about 2,700 kilometers (1,680 miles) southwest of Perth, said Anond Snidvongs, executive director of the Geo-Informatics & Space Technology Development Agency. The Japanese satellite detected about a dozen pieces of possible debris in a March 26 image, Kyodo News Service said.

The scans follow those from Airbus Group NV taken on March 23 and showing more than 100 objects about 2,560 kilometers from Perth. Satellite sightings have provided a new focus in the multination search to find the Malaysian Airline System Bhd. aircraft that vanished March 8 with 239 passengers and crew.

Eleven planes were deployed today and were all returning to Perth as the weather closed in, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authorityâ€™s Twitter feed. AMSA initially said that ships were also leaving the search zone, before saying they would try to continue the hunt.

Square-Shaped

â€œReports from the area indicate almost zero visibility,â€ said Sam Cardwell, an AMSA spokesman. â€œThe cloud is down below 500 feet, so the aircraft canâ€™t see anything.â€

The Japanese images showed objects recorded over a six-hour period yesterday in the same general search area about 2,500 miles from Perth, with 10 of the items being square-shaped, Kyodo reported, citing a government statement. The largest piece measured about 8 meters by 4 meters, it said.

The Airbus scans showed objects as long as 23 meters scattered over a 400-square kilometer area of the ocean, Malaysian officials said yesterday. The Thai images have also been sent to the Malaysian authorities, GISTDAâ€™s Anond said, as has the Japanese data, according to the Kyodo report.

â€œWe cannot tell whether the potential objects are from MH370,â€ Malaysiaâ€™s Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. â€œNevertheless, this is another new lead that will help direct the search operation.â€

Malaysian Air has said thereâ€™s no hope of survivors on the Boeing Co. 777-200ER plane.

Multiple Sightings

Todayâ€™s bad weather is expected to continue for the next 24 hours, AMSA said. Four Chinese vessels â€” the Kunlunshan, Haikou, Qiandaohu and icebreaker Xue Long â€” and Australiaâ€™s HMAS Success will remain in the area, it said.

The search was also suspended on March 25 amid gale-force winds and four-meter swells.

Since the focus shifted to the south Indian Ocean more than a week ago, planes have made multiple sightings of debris, including a wooden pallet with straps and unidentified green and orange objects, none of which have been recovered. The search covers 78,000 square kilometers of sea, AMSA said.

Malaysian authorities were also looking into what may be the final signal sent from the jet, which may help the investigators reduce the size of the search area.

Investigators have used satellite data from Inmarsat Plc to try to find Flight 370. With its communications systems shut off and no wreckage found, the engineersâ€™ conclusions have been the closest thing to a resolution of the mystery that shrouds what is now the longest search in modern airline history.

FBI Cooperation

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation should â€œwithin a day or twoâ€ finish examining the contents of computer drives from the home flight simulator built by the planeâ€™s captain, Director James B. Comey told a congressional committee yesterday. Malaysia asked for the FBIâ€™s help in retrieving files that were deleted from the simulator last month.

â€œI get briefed on it every morning,â€ Comey said. â€œI have teams working literally around the clock to try and exploit that. I donâ€™t want to say more about that in an open setting. But I expect it to be done fairly shortly within a day or two, to finish that work.â€

The FBI has received good cooperation from Malaysia, he said. Agents there â€œspeak to their counterparts every single day and update them, and get new information from them if they have it,â€ he said.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said March 24 the jetâ€™s last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean off Australiaâ€™s west coast and that the flight ended there, based on satellite data from Inmarsat.

The U.S. is sending equipment that can be towed behind a ship to help locate the aircraftâ€™s black boxes, which can emit pings for 30 days after becoming immersed in water. Recovery of the data and cockpit-voice recorders from the 777 would help investigators decipher the planeâ€™s movements and its pilotsâ€™ actions in the hours after contact was lost.

business,"PERTH, Australia (AP) ï¿½ Planes and ships searching for debris suspected of being from the missing Malaysian jetliner failed to find any today before bad weather cut their hunt short, as Thailand said one of its satellites had spotted hundreds of objects in the area.

The Thai satellite spotted the objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean near an area where planes and ships have been hunting unsuccessfully for a week for any sign of debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared March 8 with 239 people aboard.

The images from the Thai satellite showed ""300 objects of various sizes"" in the ocean, about 1,675 miles southwest of Perth, said Anond Snidvongs, director of Thailand's space technology development agency.

He said the images, taken Monday by the Thaichote satellite, took two days to process and were relayed to Malaysian authorities yesterday.

The objects were about 125 miles from the area where a French satellite on Sunday spotted 122 objects and ranged in size from 6 feet to 53 feet long, Anond said.

The announcement came after the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it had to pull back all 11 planes scheduled to take part in the search today because of heavy rain, winds and low clouds. Five ships continued the hunt.

All but three of the planes ï¿½ a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon, a Japanese P-3 Orion and a Japanese Gulfstream jet ï¿½ reached the search zone, about 1,550 miles southwest of Perth, before the air search was suspended, AMSA spokesman Sam Cardwell said.

They were there ""maybe two hours,"" and they did not find anything, Cardwell said.

""They got a bit of time in, but it was not useful because there was no visibility,"" he said.

In a message on its Twitter account, AMSA said the bad weather was expected to last 24 hours.

Planes have been flying out of Perth for a week, looking without any success for objects spotted in vague satellite images, including the French one.

Finding them would give physical confirmation that Flight 370, which was scheduled to fly from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, crashed. That would allow searchers to narrow the hunt for the wreckage of the Boeing 777 and its black boxes, which could solve the mystery of why the jet was so far off course.

Malaysian officials said earlier this week that satellite data confirmed the plane crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. Today, Malaysia Airlines ran a full-page condolence advertisement with a black background in a major newspaper.

""Our sincerest condolences go out to the loved ones of the 239 passengers, friends and colleagues. Words alone cannot express our enormous sorrow and pain,"" read the advertisement in the New Straits Times.

The 122 objects captured by the French satellite ranged in size from 3 feet to 75 feet long, but the search for them and the objects from the Thai satellite will have to wait until the weather in the search area improves, echoing the frustration of earlier sweeps that failed to zero in on three objects spotted by satellites.","PERTH, Australia (AP) ï¿½ Planes and ships searching for debris suspected of being from the missing Malaysian jetliner failed to find any today before bad weather cut their hunt short, as Thailand said one of its satellites had spotted hundreds of objects in the area.

business,"PERTH, Australia: Thunderstorms and gale-force winds grounded the international air search for wreckage from Flight MH370 yesterday, frustrating the effort again as Thailand reported a satellite sighting of hundreds of floating objects.

The Thai report was the second in two days suggesting a possible debris field from the crashed jet in the stormy southern Indian Ocean.

But a major air and sea search has frustratingly failed so far to secure any wreckage confirmed to have come from the Malaysia Airlines passenger plane which went missing on March 8 with 239 people on board.

Planes and ships have faced fierce winds and sometimes mountainous seas as they hunt for hard evidence that the plane crashed, as Malaysia has concluded.

On Tuesday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) called off both the air and sea search.

The agency suspended the air search because of worsening weather after it had got under way, but said ships would try to continue.

â€œBad weather expected for next 24 hours,â€ it tweeted.

Thailandâ€™s Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency said it had satellite images taken on Monday of 300 objects, ranging in size from two to 15 metres.

It said they were scattered over an area about 2,700 kilometres southwest of Perth, but could not confirm they were plane debris.

The agency said the objects were spotted about 200 kilometres away from an area where French satellite images earlier showed objects.

Malaysia said late Wednesday that the French images taken Sunday showed 122 floating objects including some as long as 23 metres.

The Boeing 777 is presumed to have crashed after mysteriously diverting from its Kuala Lumpur-Beijing path and apparently flying for hours in the opposite direction.

Malaysia believes the plane was deliberately redirected by someone on board, but nothing else is known.

A total of nine planes from Australia, China, Japan and New Zealand took part in yesterdayâ€™s aborted search, the Malaysian transport ministry said, along with five Chinese ships and an Australian warship.

The search suspensions caused mounting concern as the clock ticks on the signal emitted by the planeâ€™s â€˜black boxâ€™ of flight data.

The data is considered vital to unravelling the flightâ€™s mystery but the signal, aimed at guiding searchers to the device on the seabed, will expire in under two weeks.

The drama is playing out in a wild expanse of ocean described by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott as â€œabout as close to nowhere as itâ€™s possible to beâ€.

Seeking closure, anguished families of those aboard are desperately awaiting hard evidence, which might also provide some answers to one of aviationâ€™s greatest mysteries. â€” AFP","PERTH, Australia: Thunderstorms and gale-force winds grounded the international air search for wreckage from Flight MH370 yesterday, frustrating the effort again as Thailand reported a satellite sighting of hundreds of floating objects.

PERTH, Australia -- The search zone for the Malaysia airliner that crashed in the Indian Ocean nearly three weeks ago has shifted 1,100 kilometres (680 miles) to the northeast of where planes and ships had been looking for possible debris because of a ""new credible lead,"" Australia said Friday.

The revised search area comes as the weather cleared enough Friday to allow planes to hunt for fresh clues to the fate of the plane carrying 239 people that went missing March 8.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the change came after updated the new information is based on continuing analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost with the Boeing 777.

It said the analysis indicated the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated, resulting in increased fuel use and reducing the possible distance the aircraft could have flown into the Indian Ocean.

The new area is 319,000 square kilometres (123,000 square miles) and about 1,850 kilometres (1,250 miles) west of Perth, Australia, the launching area for the search. The pervious search area was more southwest and about 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles) from Perth.

""This is a credible new lead and will be thoroughly investigated today,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Friday.

""This is an extraordinarily difficult search, and an agonizing wait for family and friends of the passengers and crew,"" he said.

PERTH, Australia ï¿½ Hints about the lost Malaysian jetliner piled up Thursday, but there was precious little chance to track them down. Bad weather cut short the hunt for possible debris fields from the aircraft as satellite data revealed hundreds more objects that might be wreckage.

Not one piece of debris has been recovered from the plane that went down in the southern Indian Ocean on March 8. For relatives of the 239 people aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, it was yet another agonizing day of waiting.

""Until something is picked up and analyzed to make sure it's from MH370 we can't believe it, but without anything found it's just clues,"" Steve Wang, whose 57-year-old mother was aboard the flight, said in Beijing. ""Without that, it's useless.""

Japan said it provided Malaysia with information from satellite images taken Wednesday showing about 10 objects that might be debris from the plane, with the largest measuring about 4 meters by 8 meters (13 feet by 26 feet). The objects were located about 2,500 kilometers (1,560 miles) southwest of Perth, Japan's Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office said.



ï¿½

A Thai satellite also spotted about 300 objects, ranging from 2 meters (6 feet) to 16 meters (53 feet) long, about 2,700 kilometers (1,675 miles) southwest of Perth, said Anond Snidvongs, director of Thailand's space technology development agency. He said the images, taken Monday by the Thaichote satellite, took two days to process and were relayed to Malaysian authorities on Wednesday.

The objects were about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest of the area where a French satellite on Sunday spotted 122 objects. It's unknown whether the satellites detected the same objects; currents in the ocean can run a meter per second (about 2.2 mph) and wind also could move material.

The announcements came after the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it had to pull back all 11 planes scheduled to take part in the search Thursday because of heavy rain, winds and low clouds. Five ships continued the hunt.

All but three of the planes ï¿½ a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon, a Japanese P-3 Orion and a Japanese Gulfstream jet ï¿½ reached the search zone, about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth, before the air search was suspended, AMSA spokesman Sam Cardwell said.

Planes have been flying out of Perth for a week, seeing a few small objects that might or might not be from the plane and nothing of the possible debris fields viewed by the Thai and French satellites. Even the few objects the planes saw seemed to vanish when aircraft went back for another look.

If and when any bit of wreckage from Flight 370 is recovered and identified, searchers will be able to narrow their hunt for the rest of the Boeing 777 and its black boxes, which could solve the mystery of why the jet flew so far off-course. The plane was supposed to fly from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing but turned away from its route soon after takeoff and flew for several hours before crashing.

Anond Snidvongs, executive director of Thailand`s Geo Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency, said the Thaichote satellite or Thailand Earth Observation Satellite recorded the objects in the Indian Ocean at 10 a.m March 24, a day after images from a French satellite detected 122 floating objects, Bangkok daily The Nation reported Thursday.

Anond also said that the site where the additional 300 objects were detected was about 2,700 km from Perth, Australia, and about 200 km from the international search area where the ill-fated flight is thought to have come down.

The objects ranged from two to 15 metres in size, he added.

Anond said the images have been handed to Thai caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatara and caretaker Foreign Minister Surapong Tohvichakchaikul would forward the findings to the Malaysian authorities for further investigation if these objects belong to flight MH370.

Thaichote is a remote sensing satellite for natural resources` observation.

According to a report from Tokyo, a Japanese satellite also spotted about 10 suspicious objects possibly related to the missing airliner in the Indian Ocean.

Xinhua reported that Japan`s Kyodo News cited the Japanese government sources as saying Thursday that the square-shaped objects were spread about 2,500 km south-west of Perth, in the same area where other countries also found suspicious debris.

According to the report on Kyodo`s website, those images were taken from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday. After analysing them, the Japanese cabinet has supplied related information to Malaysia, it said.

It is believed that the biggest object is eight metres long, four meters wide. Some analysts from Japanese government thought there is a big possibility that the objects belong to the missing flight.

Meanwhile, search operations for the lost jetliner in the southern Indian Ocean were suspended Thursday due to bad weather.

â€œToday`s (Thursday`s) search operations have been suspended due to bad weather. All planes are returning to Perth and ships are leaving the search area,â€ the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) tweeted.

It later added: â€œShips staying in search area and will attempt to continue searching, but all planes returning. Bad weather expected for next 24 hours.â€

Earlier Thursday, the AMSA, which is coordinating the ongoing multinational search operation, said in an update that the search and recovery operations for flight MH370 resumed with six military aircraft, five civil aircraft and five ships.

Three objects were spotted Wednesday by two aircraft but these could not be relocated despite several passes. These were unrelated to the credible satellite imagery provided to AMSA.

Positions in the satellite information released by Malaysia Remote Sensing Agency Wednesday were within Wednesdayâ€™s search area.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished mysteriously about an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur shortly after midnight March 8.

The Boeing 777-200ER was scheduled to land in Beijing the same day. The 226 passengers on board included five Indians, 154 Chinese and 38 Malaysians.

The plane lost contact along with its radar signal when it was flying over the air traffic control area of Vietnam`s Ho Chi Minh City.

According to report from Beijing, Chinese insurance companies Thursday said they have begun paying compensation to the families of passengers aboard the missing lost jet even though there is no concrete evidence yet about its fate.

The companies said that they started the process of paying compensation immediately after Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Monday that the flight ""ended"" in the southern Indian Ocean, even though no concrete evidence or full information has supported this conclusion yet.","According to a report from Tokyo, a Japanese satellite also spotted about 10 suspicious objects possibly related to the missing airliner in the Indian Ocean.

business,"It has been 19 days since Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing in the early hours of March 8, prompting an international search for the Boeing 777-200ER and its 227 passengers and 12 crew members.

While manned searches by air and sea have turned up scant results, satellite signal analysis and satellite imagery have helped narrow the search area for the missing Flight MH370, which is now believed to have gone down somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean off the southwest coast of Australia.

Following the official Malaysian government announcement that satellite analysis by Inmarsat PLC (LON:ISAT) had placed Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean, more data provided by satellites have continued to emerge.

On Wednesday, a France-based Airbus Defense and Space satellite reportedly spotted hundreds of debris pieces floating 1,600 miles off the coast of southwestern Australia. Then Thailand reported Thursday that one of its satellites had spotted 300 debris pieces in the southern Indian Ocean.

However, this particular patch of debris spotted by the Thai satellite was discovered approximately 124 miles from the location of the debris spotted by the French satellite.

The images captured by the Thaichote satellite were taken on Monday, but took two days to process before being relayed to Malaysian officials on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. It is currently unknown if the debris pieces are related to Flight MH370.

Unfortunately, air- and sea-based search-and-rescue operations were temporarily halted on Thursday as poor weather conditions hampered ongoing efforts to find the remains of Flight MH370.

Despite this setback, the international community has continued to use every tool available to locate Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, whose disappearance has continued to baffle the world.","On Wednesday, a France-based Airbus Defense and Space satellite reportedly spotted hundreds of debris pieces floating 1,600 miles off the coast of southwestern Australia.

Ten aircraft, including a New Zealand Orion, were scheduled to fly out from Perth to the new area on Friday, about 1800km west of the Australian city and 1100km north of where searchers had been concentrating for more than a week.

The shift in the search area, moving it further than the distance between London and Berlin, followed analysis of radar data from Malaysia showing the Boeing 777 had travelled faster, and so would have run out of fuel quicker, than previously thought.

The new search area is larger at 319,000 square kilometres - roughly the size of Poland - but closer to the West Australian city, allowing aircraft to spend longer on site by shortening travel times. It is also vastly more favourable in terms of the weather, as it is out of the deep sea region known as the Roaring 40s for its huge seas and frequent storm-force winds, Reuters reports.

""I'm not sure that we'll get perfect weather out there, but it's likely to be better more often than what we've seen in the past,"" John Young, general manager of the emergency response division of Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), told reporters on Friday, adding that the previous search site was being abandoned for a more ""credible lead"".

Satellite orbits are being changed to take photographs of the new search zone. A flotilla of Australian and Chinese ships would take longer to shift north, however, with the Australian naval ship the HMAS Success not due to arrive until Saturday morning.

The US Navy said on Friday it was sending a second P8-Poseidon, its most advanced maritime surveillance aircraft, to help. The US has also sent a device that can be towed behind a ship to pick up faint pings from the plane's black box voice and data recorders, but time is running out as the black box has limited battery life.

Frustrating hunt

The latest twist underscores the perplexing and frustrating hunt for evidence in the near three-week search. It comes less than a day after the latest reports of sightings of possible wreckage, captured by Thai and Japanese satellites in roughly the same frigid expanse of sea as earlier images reported by France, Australia and China.

On Thursday, Thailand's space agency reported satellite images showing 300 items floating in the southern Indian Ocean, ranging from two to 15 metres in size, that could be debris from the ill-fated flight. That discovery was reported less than 24 hours after the Malaysian government revealed 122 objects had been seen about 2557km from Perth, ranging in length from one metre to 23 metres.

Potential debris has also been seen from search aircraft, but none has been picked up or confirmed as the wreckage of Flight MH370.

Officials believe someone on board may have shut off the plane's communications systems before flying it thousands of kilometres off course, where it crashed into the ocean in one of the world's most isolated and forbidding regions.

Theories range from a hijacking to sabotage or a possible suicide by one of the pilots, but investigators have not ruled out technical problems.

The prolonged and so far fruitless search and investigation have taken a toll, with dozens of distraught relatives of 150 Chinese passengers clashing with police and accusing Malaysia of ""delays and deception"".

Chinese insurance companies have started paying compensation to the families of passengers, some of the firms and state media said.","Australian officials coordinating international efforts to find the missing Malaysian airliner moved the search area in the southern Indian Ocean on Friday, after new calculations on the plane's speed.

More possible debris from the missing Malaysian Airlines jet that is thought to have crashed in the Indian Ocean earlier this month was spotted by Thai satellites, according to search officials.

The Thai satellite images revealed more than 300 floating objects near where investigators think the Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 may have crashed, reported NBC News.

The potential plane debris was seen by the Thailand Earth Observation Satellite, or Thaichote, and the images have since been relayed to Malaysian authorities, said Anond Snidvongs, executive director of the Geo Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (Gistda), a state-owned research organization, headquartered in Bangkok, that reports to Thailand's defense ministry. [Facts & Timeline About Malaysia Flight 370]

""Our satellites have located numerous amounts of floating objects at the area about 1,700 miles [2,740 kilometers] southwest of Perth and those objects have been identified as real and not just a silhouette or fish or anything else,"" Snidvongs told NBC News. ""It's probably man-made, but we cannot identify or confirm its origin.""

The floating objects were seen within the established search area in the southern Indian Ocean, he said.

The new images, captured on Monday (March 24), were posted on the Gistda website. These potential new leads come a day after a French satellite spotted a debris field consisting of 122 floating objects located roughly 1,600 miles (2,575 km) off the coast of the Australian city of Perth.

The Malaysian Airlines jetliner has been missing since March 8, when it mysteriously disappeared during a scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The precise whereabouts of the plane, and the 239 people onboard, remain unknown, but an ongoing investigation has concentrated search efforts within a swath of the southern Indian Ocean.

Earlier this week, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that further analysis of data from the British Inmarsat satellite company concluded that Flight 370's last known position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Perth.

""This is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites,"" Razak said Monday. ""It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.""

An international search effort, led by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, is ongoing across the southern Indian Ocean. Patrol planes and ships from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China and South Korea remain active in the area.

Planes and ships searching for debris suspected of being from the missing Malaysian airliner have failed to find any before bad weather cut their hunt short.

The delay came as Thailand said one of its satellites had spotted hundreds of objects in the area.

The Thai satellite spotted the objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean near an area where planes and ships have been hunting unsuccessfully for a week for any sign of debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8 with 239 people aboard.

The images from the Thai satellite showed ""300 objects of various sizes"" in the ocean, about 2,700 kilometres (1,675 miles) south west of Perth, said Anond Snidvongs, director of Thailand's space technology development agency.

He said the images, taken on Monday by the Thaichote satellite, took two days to process and were relayed to Malaysian authorities yesterday.

The objects were about 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the area where a French satellite on Sunday spotted 122 objects, and ranged in size from two metres (six feet) to 16 metres (53 feet) long, Mr Anond said.

The announcement came after the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it had to pull back all 11 planes scheduled to take part in the search today because of heavy rain, winds and low clouds. Five ships continued the hunt.

All but three of the planes - a US Navy P-8 Poseidon, a Japanese P-3 Orion and a Japanese Gulfstream jet - reached the search zone, about 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles) south west of Perth, before the air search was suspended, AMSA spokesman Sam Cardwell said.

They were there ""maybe two hours"" and they did not find anything, Mr Cardwell said.

""They got a bit of time in, but it was not useful because there was no visibility,"" he said.

In a message on its Twitter account, AMSA said the bad weather was expected to last 24 hours.

Planes have been flying out of Perth for a week, looking without any success for objects spotted in vague satellite images, including the French one.

Finding them would give physical confirmation that Flight 370, which was scheduled to fly from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, crashed. That would allow searchers to narrow the hunt for the wreckage of the Boeing 777 and its black boxes, which could solve the mystery of why the jet was so far off-course.

Malaysian officials said earlier this week that satellite data confirmed the plane crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. Malaysia Airlines ran a full-page condolence advertisement with a black background in a major newspaper.

""Our sincerest condolences go out to the loved ones of the 239 passengers, friends and colleagues. Words alone cannot express our enormous sorrow and pain,"" read the advertisement in the New Straits Times.

The 122 objects captured by the French satellite ranged in size from one meter (3 feet) to 23 meters (75 feet) long, but the search for them and the objects from the Thai satellite will have to wait until the weather in the search area improves, echoing the frustration of earlier sweeps that failed to zero in on three objects spotted by satellites.

Experts cautioned that the area's frequent high seas and bad weather and its distance from land were complicating an already difficult search.

""This is a really rough piece of ocean, which is going to be a terrific issue,"" said Kerry Sieh, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore. ""I worry that people carrying out the rescue mission are going to get into trouble.""

Malaysia has been criticised over its handling of one of the most perplexing mysteries in aviation history. Much of the most strident criticism has come from relatives of the Chinese passengers, some of whom expressed outrage that Malaysia essentially declared their loved ones dead without recovering a single piece of wreckage.","A Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force AP-3C Orion returns to Perth after searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 (AP)Search for Malaysia plane cut short BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Planes and ships searching for debris suspected of being from the missing Malaysian airliner have failed to find any before bad weather cut their hunt short.

business,"A U.S Navy black box detector and a Bluefin-21 underwater drone have arrived in Perth, Australia, to help in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which disappeared on March 8 after abruptly veering off of its scheduled course to Beijing. On Monday, March 24, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced in a televised press conference that according to data from British satellite company Inmarsat, the missing flight had ""ended"" in the Indian Ocean.

Satellite images taken by France's Airbus Defense and Space on Sunday were released yesterday and described by the acting minister of transport, Hishammuddin Hussein, as the ""most credible"" evidence yet. The images show 122 objects in what is being described as a possible ""debris"" field. The images are also located near previously spotted images by Australian and Chinese satellites. According to the Guardian, the debris field captured by the French satellite is around 400 square kilometers or approximately 150 square miles. The search zone in its entirety is 30,000 square miles.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, in a release yesterday, said that the search area would be split into eastern and western zones, each with six planes and a ship. However, the Guardian is now reporting that there are only 11 planes taking part in the search. Planes from Australia, the United States, China, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea are involved in the search. China has also sent several ships to the area including an icebreaker that had been docked in Perth post-Antarctic mission.

On top of combing the ocean for physical evidence of where the plane might have gone down, the search team is also looking for what is described as ""acoustic pings"" emanating from the plane's black box. The plane's black box has a cockpit voice recorder and also a data recorder; beacons for each of these recording devices will go off once the black box makes contact with water. The beacons will let off a signal every second -- but only for 30 days. This means that the search team has until April 7.

The Guardian reported that the maker of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370's black box, Dukane Seacom, says that the batteries for the beacons may last an extra five days. If so there's a small hope that the search team has until April 12 to find the black box and what happened to the missing Boeing 777 and 239 passengers who presumably died on board.

Search crews will attach the black box finder to Royal Australian Navyâ€™s HMAS Ocean Shield and tow it through the water to pick up signals. The Bluefin-21 drone will dive deep and use sonar to detect any sunken debris.

Without any physical evidence, there has been widespread skepticism that the plane ran out of fuel and crashed into the Indian Ocean. Families of the passengers have expressed anger and frustration with the Malaysian government and Malaysian Airlines for their handling of the tragedy. In Beijing some families of the 154 missing Chinese passengers protested at the Malaysian Embassy, chanting, marching and throwing water bottles.

Yesterday a Chinese special envoy to Malaysia, Zhang Yesui, met with officials and demanded to see all of the evidence that the plane went down in the Indian Ocean. According to Reuters, he called for ""unremitting efforts"" to find the plane.

business,"Images of 300 floating objects passed on to Malaysia as MH370 search continues

A Thai satellite has detected 300 floating objects in the Indian Ocean, about 200 kilometres from the area where a search is being conducted for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.

Anond Snidvongs, executive director of Geo Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (Gistda), said the Thailand Earth Observation Satellite or Thaichote had recorded the objects in the Indian Ocean on Monday at 10am.

This site is about 2,700 kilometres from Perth, Australia, and some 200 kilometres from the area where the flight is believed to have crashed. Some objects were more than two metres long, Anond said.

Speaking at the same press conference, Science Minister Peerapan Palusuk said the satellite, which orbits the Earth, was initially cover other areas but was moved to where foreign satellites had reportedly detected debris. Then on Monday, Thaichote captured images of several floating objects beyond the location mentioned by the foreign satellites.

The minister added that he was glad Thailand could help Malaysia in the hunt for the missing jet.

Anond explained that Gistda had been contacted by several foreign space agencies, who wanted Thaichote to look in the southern Indian Ocean to the southwest of Perth and on Monday, it recorded images of possibly as many as 300 objects in the area.

â€œThe resolution of the images on Thaichote were not good enough even after we removed noise such as waves and clouds. We are confident that what we saw were floating objects, but we canâ€™t say what they are,â€ Anond said. He pointed out that in an area that is so far from land, there should not be so many floating objects. Though Gistda has said it will try to verify the accuracy of the location again, the job might be tough as there is no station on land to confirm it.

â€œWe will capture images at the same location again,â€ he said, adding that he believed the error margin for the location calculated from the images should be no greater than 5 kilometres, adding that Malaysia and relevant agencies would be asked to verify the objects.

Anond said the findings had already been submitted to caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and that Foreign Minister Surapong Tovichak-chaikul had forwarded them to his Malaysian counterpart to see if the debris could be that of MH370.

The Thaichote satellite is normally used to observe natural resources.

Using data derived from â€œpingsâ€ from the plane, UK satellite firm Inmarsat concluded that the flight had crashed in the Indian Ocean and all passengers were presumed dead. Though a satellite image showed 122 objects in the Indian Ocean, search teams have yet to find them.","We are confident that what we saw were floating objects, but we canâ€™t say what they are,â€ Anond said.

business,"John Young of the AMSA and the new search area[EPA]

Teams searching for the missing Malaysian plane have spotted new objects in the sea after moving the search area 1,100km northeast.

A New Zealand search plane captured the images while searching the new area today, after Australian officials said the plane would have run out of fuel earlier than previously thought.

A new analysis of radar data suggests that the plane had flown faster and therefore used fuel more quickly.

A ship will arrive in the area tomorrow to identify the new objects.

The change in search area does not necessarily mean that hundreds of objects spotted in the sea in a different area are not from the plane, acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said today.

He said: ""The Australian authorities have indicated that they have shifted the search area approximately 1,100 kilometres to the northeast.

""Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week. This work is on-going, and we can expect further refinements.""

Four planes were in the new search area today and six ships were headed there, according to John Young, manager of Australian Maritime Safety Authority emergency response division.

He said the search had ""moved on"" from the previous co-ordinates.

AMSA said the change in search areas came from new information based on continuing analysis of the radar data received soon after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 lost communications and veered from its scheduled path March 8.

The Beijing-bound flight carrying 239 people turned around soon after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, flew west toward the Malacca Strait and disappeared from radar.

The search area has changed several times since the plane vanished as experts analysed a frustratingly small amount of data from the aircraft, including the radar signals and ""pings"" that a satellite picked up for several hours after radar contact was lost.

The latest analysis indicated the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated, resulting in increased fuel use and reducing the possible distance the aircraft could have flown before going down in the Indian Ocean.","John Young of the AMSA and the new search area[EPA]Teams searching for the missing Malaysian plane have spotted new objects in the sea after moving the search area 1,100km northeast.

business,"BANGKOK, Thailand â€“ Thai satellite images have shown 300 floating objects in the southern Indian Ocean during a search for the missing Malaysian airliner, an official said Thursday.

The objects, ranging from two to 15 meters (6.5 to 50 feet) in size, were scattered over an area about 2,700 kilometres (1,680 miles) southwest of Perth, according to the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency.

""But we cannot â€“ dare not â€“ confirm they are debris from the plane,"" the agency's executive director, Anond Snidvongs, told AFP.

He said the information had been given to Malaysia.

The pictures were taken by Thailand's only earth observation satellite on Monday but needed several days to process, Anond added.

He said the objects were spotted about 200 kilometers away from an area where French satellite images earlier showed potential objects in the search for the Boeing 777 which vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard.

Thailand faced criticism after announcing more than a week after the jet's disappearance that its radar had picked up an ""unknown aircraft"" minutes after flight MH370 last transmitted its location.

The Thai air force said it did not report the findings earlier as the plane was not considered a threat.

The Malaysia Airlines plane is presumed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean after mysteriously diverting from its Kuala Lumpur-Beijing path and apparently flying for hours in the opposite direction. (Read: MH370 ended at the southern Indian Ocean)

British Airways is drawing criticism from travellers over the poor timing of one of its ads.

Users on Reddit were quick to upload images the ad, suggesting the ad's run time was too soon given the recent developments over missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. On Monday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced satellite data pointed to the missing plane crashing into a remote corner of the Indian Ocean.

British Airways has verified the ad is real and says the campaign behind it was planned long before the event of the missing airliner.

""We are very sorry for any offence caused, and the advertising is being withdrawn. This campaign was planned some months ago and we recognize that its appearance at this time is inappropriate,"" a BA spokesperson told the Huffington Post Canada.

Commuters on the London Underground say they've seen the ad running at Euston Station, according to the Independent but the ad has since spread worldwide via Twitter just hours later.","The image in question features clear blue waters with text asking travellers to ""escape the commute and discover the Indian Ocean"".

business,"In the wake of news that no one survived flight 370, Chicagoans held a vigil Monday to mourn their loss. Rob Elgas reports. (Published Tuesday, March 25, 2014)

Court documents that often precede a lawsuit have been filed by a U.S. law firm on behalf of a relative of a passenger on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

The filing in Chicago asks a judge to order Malaysia Airlines and Chicago-based Boeing Co. to turn over documents related to the possible ""negligence"" caused the Boeing 777 to crash, including any documentation about the chances of ""fatal depressurization"" in the cockpit.

""Additional pleadings will be filed in the next few days against other potential defendants who are designers and manufacturers of the component parts that may have failed in the aircraft,"" Chicago-based Ribbeck Law Chartered attorney Monica Kelly said in a statement. The documents filed Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court seek to preserve evidence.

They were filed on behalf of Januari Siregar, who the law firm says is a relative of Indonesian-born passenger Firman Chandra Siregar. The filings were not clear about their exact relationship.

Kelly said lawyers are asking a judge to order Boeing to provide the names of companies that manufactured the locator beacon, the electric components, batteries and fire alarm systems, the emergency oxygen generators and those who last inspected the aircraft's fuselage. The law firm is also seeking from Malaysian Airlines the identities of people with information about the training of the crew; their physical and psychological evaluations; and the security practices of the airline.

Boeing spokesman John Dern declined comment. Phone and email messages were left for airline officials Wednesday.

In its corporate self-portrait, Ribbeck Law boasts of its success at obtaining compensation for the families of victims of aviation disasters. The National Transportation Safety Board complained after the crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 in San Francisco last year that some attorneys may have violated a U.S. law barring uninvited solicitation of air disaster victims in the first 45 days after an accident.

The NTSB pointed specifically at Ribbeck Law, reporting the firm to Illinois' Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. It was unclear Wednesday if the agency took any action on the complaint.

At the time, Kelly said the firm legally and ethically obtained its clients related to the crash and that all initiated contact with the firm, which is representing 83 passengers of the Asiana flight.

business,"Perth: Hints about the lost Malaysian jetliner piled up Thursday, but there was precious little chance to track them down. Bad weather cut short the hunt for possible debris fields from the aircraft as satellite data revealed hundreds more objects that might be wreckage.

Not one piece of debris has been recovered from the plane that went down in the southern Indian Ocean on 8 March. For relatives of the 239 people aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, it was yet another agonizing day of waiting.

""Until something is picked up and analyzed to make sure it's from MH370 we can't believe it, but without anything found it's just clues,"" Steve Wang, whose 57-year-old mother was aboard the flight, said in Beijing. ""Without that, it's useless.""

Japan said it provided Malaysia with information from satellite images taken Wednesday showing about 10 objects that might be debris from the plane, with the largest measuring about 4 meters by 8 meters (13 feet by 26 feet). The objects were located about 2,500 kilometers (1,560 miles) southwest of Perth, Japan's Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office said.

A Thai satellite also spotted about 300 objects, ranging from 2 meters (6 feet) to 16 meters (53 feet) long, about 2,700 kilometers (1,675 miles) southwest of Perth, said Anond Snidvongs, director of Thailand's space technology development agency. He said the images, taken Monday by the Thaichote satellite, took two days to process and were relayed to Malaysian authorities on Wednesday.

The objects were about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest of the area where a French satellite on Sunday spotted 122 objects. It's unknown whether the satellites detected the same objects; currents in the ocean can run a meter per second (about 2.2 mph) and wind also could move material.

The announcements came after the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it had to pull back all 11 planes scheduled to take part in the search Thursday because of heavy rain, winds and low clouds. Five ships continued the hunt.

All but three of the planes â€” a US Navy P-8 Poseidon, a Japanese P-3 Orion and a Japanese Gulfstream jet â€” reached the search zone, about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth, before the air search was suspended, AMSA spokesman Sam Cardwell said.

They were there ""maybe two hours"" and found nothing, Cardwell said. ""They got a bit of time in, but it was not useful because there was no visibility.""

In a message on its Twitter account, AMSA said the bad weather was expected to last 24 hours.

Planes have been flying out of Perth for a week, seeing a few small objects that might or might not be from the plane and nothing of the possible debris fields viewed by the Thai and French satellites. Even the few objects the planes saw seemed to vanish when aircraft went back for another look.

If and when any bit of wreckage from Flight 370 is recovered and identified, searchers will be able to narrow their hunt for the rest of the Boeing 777 and its black boxes, which could solve the mystery of why the jet flew so far off-course. The plane was supposed to fly from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing but turned away from its route soon after takeoff and flew for several hours before crashing.

Malaysian officials said earlier this week that satellite data confirmed the plane crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. On Thursday, Malaysia Airlines ran a full-page condolence advertisement with a black background in a major Malaysian newspaper.

""Our sincerest condolences go out to the loved ones of the 239 passengers, friends and colleagues. Words alone cannot express our enormous sorrow and pain,"" read the advertisement in the New Straits Times.

The extreme remoteness of the search area, its frequent high seas and bad weather all complicate the search.

""This is a really rough piece of ocean, which is going to be a terrific issue,"" said Kerry Sieh, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore. ""I worry that people carrying out the rescue mission are going to get into trouble.""

Malaysia has been criticized over its handling of one of the most perplexing mysteries in aviation history. Much of the most strident criticism has come from relatives of the Chinese passengers, some of whom expressed outrage that Malaysia essentially declared their loved ones dead without recovering a single piece of wreckage.

China dispatched a special envoy to Kuala Lumpur, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui, to deal with the crisis. Zhang met with Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein on Wednesday and received a briefing on the satellite data that ""led to the conclusion that MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean,"" Malaysia's Ministry of Transport said in a statement.

On Thursday, Malaysian officials met with China's ambassador to Malaysia, Huang Huikang, ""to request the government of China to engage and clarify the actual situation to the affected families in particular and the Chinese public in general,"" the statement said.

Officials still don't know why Flight 370 disappeared. Investigators have ruled out nothing â€” including mechanical or electrical failure, hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or someone else on board.

On Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey told members of Congress that his investigators should finish in a day or two their analysis of electronics owned by the pilot and co-pilot, work that includes trying to recover files deleted from a home flight simulator used by Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah.

Some speculation has focused on Zaharie and his state of mind, but his son, in an interview published Thursday in the New Straits Times, rejected the idea that his father might be to blame.

""I've read everything online. But I've ignored all the speculation. I know my father better,"" Ahmad Seth said.

The search for the missing Malaysian airliner was suspended Thursday, the second time this week that severe weather in the southern Indian Ocean had made flying to the possible wreckage zone too risky for search crews.Lt. Cmdr. Adam Schantz, the head of a U.S. team flying a Navy surveillance plane, said the search zone was afflicted by ""severe turbulence, severe icing and basically zero visibility.""""Anyone who is out there is coming home,"" he said at the Perth airport. ""And all additional sorties are cancelled.""There were hopes that search flights Thursday would scour the area where European satellite images made public Wednesday showed 122 floating objects. If confirmed as wreckage from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the search could have been considerably narrowed.A Thai government agency said Thursday that it, too, had spotted from one of its satellites what appeared to be a relatively compact field of debris near the search zone. The images were taken on Monday, one day after the European satellite pictures.The head of the Thai agency, the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency, told reporters in Bangkok that the images showed around 300 objects over an area of 450 square kilometres. The agency said it was confident that the images showed floating objects but cautioned that it could not describe them in detail because the images were of a relatively low resolution.Anond Snidvongs, the agency's executive director, said the objects seen by the Thai satellite were 200 kilometres southwest of the objects in the European satellite images.After two and a half weeks of searches, there have been multiple sightings of possible debris, but no wreckage has been retrieved. Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur on March 8 and veered southward into the Indian Ocean for unknown reasons.The probable area of impact of the aircraft, calculated from satellite pings emitted by the plane before it went down, is more than 620,000 square miles, or roughly three times the size of mainland France.Search aircraft have only been able to search roughly 5 percent of that area each day.Six military and five civilian aircraft had been due to search in the area Thursday, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.Five ships, including four Chinese vessels, are also in the vicinity, but it seems unlikely they would be able to search Thursday because of the poor conditions.Schantz said clouds were down to the surface of the water and visibility was so bad that aircraft would have trouble seeing their wingtips.The search area is known as the ""roaring forties"" - a reference to the latitude and notoriously fierce weather conditions.Roger Badham, a meteorologist based near Sydney, said there might be a break in the weather Friday but that more rain was forecast for Sunday, with low clouds likely to again reduce visibility from aircraft.But the weather in the search zone is unpredictable and difficult to forecast, especially because the nearest climate monitoring stations are on the Australian mainland and in Antarctica, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.Badham and other experts say search efforts will be increasingly challenging as winter approaches.""The storms build more frequently and with greater intensity in the winter,"" Badham said. ""It is not always blowing like hell but you can get some doozy fronts coming through.""Will Oxley, a professional sailor who has twice sailed through the search area, called it ""one of the very rough parts of the world.""""It can be a pretty wild place,"" he said. ""Historically, in around-the-world yacht races, more accidents have happened in the southern Indian Ocean than elsewhere.""Shorter days could also hamper the search effort. Oxley said on December 31, the search area gets around 15.5 hours of daylight. But by the end of June there would be just 9 hours of daylight.

business,"The search for Flight MH370â€™s black boxes is a desperate one almost three-weeks to the date in which the Malaysia Airlines plane disappeared from radar.

After the grim announcement by the Malaysian PM, who said authorities in his country believe Flight MH370 met its fate in the southern Indian Ocean â€” effectively killing everyone on board â€” all the search and rescue efforts continue in he inhospitable area off the coast of Perth, Australia.

On Wednesday, news surfaced that 122 objects had been spotted by satellites and shared by France. On Thursday, similar information saying that 300 objects have been detected in the area close to where the search efforts continue for Flight MH370.

Aside from recovering the remains of the 239 souls on board the lost plane, investigators are looking for the black boxes, which are actually orange, and could offer potentially crucial information as to what took place in the cockpit (voice recorder) and the actual data given off by the aircraft before Flight MH370 supposedly crashed.

With no physical evidence recovered thus far, many are still skeptical at the assertion that the Malaysian plane crashed where the PM says it did, after all, since the beginning of the investigation there has been contradictory information released and withheld from the media and families of passengers of Flight MH370.

The latest discovery was made by the Thailand Earth Observation Satellite (Thaichote), the executive director of the Geo Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (Gistda), Anond Snidvongs, told NBC News.

â€œOur satellites have located numerous amounts of floating objects at the area about 1700 miles southwest of Perth and those objects have been identified as real and not just a silhouette or fish or anything else. Itâ€™s probably man made but we cannot identify or confirm its origin.â€ â€œThe area is within the general area that we were notified to look in. There are 300 objects or even more. One of the satellites has seen about 175 square miles.â€

The images â€” which were posted in the companyâ€™s website â€” have been shared with Malaysian government officials in charge of the investigation into the disappearance of Flight MH370 and were taken on Monday, the day after the French discovery of possible debris.

The area in which the objects were spotted is located about 125 miles southwest of the place in which Flight MH370 ended, according to Snidvongs.

Malaysian investigators cancelled the daily news briefing on Thursday and have had no further comment on the new objects that could possibly be part of the wreckage of Flight MH370 and guide them towards the much sough black boxes.

Flight MH370: The Search Continues

As new satellite images â€” described by Malaysian officials as the most credible lead to Flight MH370â€™s whereabouts â€” show 122 pieces of possible debris in the same area where the most recent search has focused, 11 aircraft, five ships, hundreds of personnel and all kinds of sophisticated equipment from the US, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand are posed to scour the area, above and below the waves.

The Guardian:

Officials from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the search on Thursday had been split into two areas totaling 78,000 square kilometres (30,000 square miles). Locating and retrieving at least some of the floating objects, ranging in length from one to 23 metres, could prove crucial in the absence of any physical evidence supporting the theory that MH370 ran out of fuel hours after it turned sharply off course and disappeared from air traffic controllersâ€™ screens over the South China Sea en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Search teams are hoping the detection equipment will be able to pick up acoustic pings emitted every second from the planeâ€™s black box flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. Each of the two recorders has a beacon, attached to the outside of the black box, which once activated by contact with water makes a sound every second. But it is a race against time â€“ the beacons have a battery life of just 30 days, after which the pings begin to fade. Chuck Schofield of Dukane Seacom, a company that has sold the pingers to Malaysia Airlines, told Associated Press the batteries might last an additional five days before dying. Assuming that the plane crashed on 8 March, as Malaysian officials insist, that means the beacons aboard MH370 will begin to fade around 7 April and could go silent around 12 April.

The U.S. Navy has already moved a â€œTowed Pinger Locator hydrophoneâ€ and a â€œBluefin-21 Side-scan sonarâ€ to Perth for transportation to the presumed crash site and is sending a second P-8A Poseidon Patrol aircraft to Perth to aid in the search efforts. Harsh weather conditions, including ceilings as low as 800 feet and potential icing conditions, make the addition of the all-weather P-8 extremely valuable, says the U.S. 7th Fleet Public Affairs. U.S. Navy patrol aircraft have already flown 16 missions, flying more than 150 flight hours and covering 220,000 square nautical miles.

Cmdr. Tom Moneymaker, U.S. 7th Fleet oceanographer, says â€œItâ€™s critical to continue searching for debris so we can reverse-forecast the wind, current and sea state since March 8th to recreate the position where MH370 possibly went into the water. Weâ€™ve got to get this initial position right prior to deploying the Towed Pinger Locator since the MH370â€™s black box has a limited battery life and we canâ€™t afford to lose time searching in the wrong area.â€

The Navy describes the new P-8 Poseidon as follows:

In terms of mission effectiveness and reliability, the P-8A represents a leap forward for the Navyâ€™s maritime patrol and reconnaissance community. The aircraft has a maximum speed of 490 knots, a ceiling of 41,000 feet, and provides a range of more than 1,200 nautical miles with four hours on station. For a mission such as the MH370 search, the P-8 will typically fly at 5,000 feet at 350 knots, dropping to 1,000 feet to get a visual identification of any radar returns. It may also fly at 1,000 feet for an extended period of the flight, depending on the environment and mission for the flight. It has a search time of approximately eight, nine hours depending on distance to search area, though during this mission the search time on station is greatly reduced due to the distance of the search area from Perth. The P-8A is the most advanced long range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft in the world. A true multi-mission aircraft, it also provides superior maritime intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability. Built on the proven Boeing 737 airframe, the P-8A brings with it enhanced safety and reduced maintenance.

business,"Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 possible debris detected as the satellite spotted 300 floating objects, about 2, 700km south west of Perth.

As the hope of reuniting with the passengers of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 extinguished when it was confirmed by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak that the aircraft went down in a remote area of the Indian Ocean, a recent update from the Thai satellite was confirmed which showed 300 floating objects which could probably be the debris of the said plane.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was a scheduled international passenger flight that went missing on March 8, 2014. The said flight departed from the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and was scheduled to arrive in Beijing Capital International Airport however; it didn't reach its destination. The aircraft carrying 239 people on board was reported to lost contact with the air traffic control less than an hour after it took off.

As the news of the missing aircraft broke off, joint search and rescue efforts were initiated coming not just from the Malaysian government but from the other nations as well. Speculations of hijack and possible terrorism were never out of the picture as the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went on.

Moreover, there were previous reports that military radar picked up an unidentified plane which made a sharp turn and descending to a much lower altitude before heading out into the Indian Ocean just after the aircraft lost contact with the air traffic control. On March 16 and 18, satellite images of possible aircraft debris were spotted in the southern Indian Ocean, southwest of Western Australia. Further possible debris was spotted on March 24 by the Australian and Chinese military.

Officials then concluded that beyond any reasonable doubt, the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 crashed in the southern Indian Ocean with no survivors. Prime Minister Razak made the announcement to the public ending the 17-day ordeal.

The Thai satellite spotted 300 floating objects which could be the possible aircraft debris on Thursday. The said objects ranges from two meters to sixteen meters long, about south west of Perth. Spotted objects were about 200 kilometers southwest where the French satellite spotted 122 objects on Sunday.

As images of the possible aircraft debris continuously emerge, none of the photographed debris was recovered by the ships searching the area. Search operations are complicated by the extreme remoteness of the area, high seas and bad weather condition.

business,"Thailand said on Thursday it could have a lead on possible wreckage from missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, according to media reports. Its latest satellite images revealed roughly 300 floating objects, ranging from two to 15 meters (6.6 to 50 feet) in size.

The images pointed to an area some 2,700 kilometers southwest of Perth, within the zone where officials believe the plane crashed after losing contact with air traffic control on March 8.

Search halted

Earlier Thursday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) cancelled reconnaissance flights to Thursday's search zone in the southern Indian Ocean after severe weather forecasts proved too dangerous. The suspension grounded six military planes and five civilian aircraft participating in the search and rescue operation for the missing Boeing 777.

The aircraft were in the air ""maybe two hours,"" ASMA spokesperson Sam Cardwell said. ""They got a bit of time in, but it was not useful because there was no visibility.""

Five ships would remain out at sea for the time being, ASMA confirmed.

Rescuers on Thursday had been scheduled to reach the search zone where satellite images had spotted 122 ""potential objects,"" which Malaysian officials said they believed could be wreckage from MH370.

AMSA had issued a similar suspension earlier in the week, a move which sparked protests in Beijing. Distraught family members of the missing passengers marched on the Malaysian embassy, demanding more answers from officials. Two-thirds of the passengers on board MH370 were Chinese nationals.

Logistical problems

The international search team - relying on logistical support form the US, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - is tasked with searching an area of 1.6 million square kilometers (622,000 square miles), which is roughly the size of Iran.

Not only have poor weather conditions impeded search efforts, but the remoteness of the area has also made the recovery of any possible debris extremely difficult.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the search area ""as close to nowhere as it's possible.""

Experts have moreover warned that the unchartered terrain in the southern Indian Ocean could also prove dangerous to the crew.

""This is a really rough piece of ocean, which is going to be a terrific issue,"" the director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore, Kerry Sieh, told news agency AFP. ""I worry that people carrying out the rescue mission are going to get into trouble.""

business,"The FBI will soon complete its analysis of data from a flight simulator taken from the home of the pilot of a missing Malaysia Airlines jet, the US agency's director has said.

Malaysian officials had asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to help recover files deleted from the simulator's hard drive.

FBI chief James Comey told lawmakers yesterday that experts were working ""literally round the clock"" to finish their analysis, in the hopes that the data could provide clues as to what happened to Flight 370, which vanished March 8 with 239 passengers and crew on board.

Malaysia ""took us up on our technical abilities, which involves the exploitation of certain computer forensic materials that they've given to us. That work is ongoing,"" Comey told a House subcommittee meeting to discuss the FBI's 2015 budget request.

""I don't want to say more about that in an open setting, but I expect it to be done fairly shortly, within a day or two.""



Malaysian police removed the simulator from Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's home nearly two weeks ago, after investigators said they believed the Boeing 777 had been deliberately diverted from its intended route by someone on board.

Malaysia on Monday announced that evidence showed the jet crashed in the southern Indian Ocean.

Comey did not indicate whether the results of the analysis would be made public.","The FBI will soon complete its analysis of data from a flight simulator taken from the home of the pilot of a missing Malaysia Airlines jet, the US agency's director has said.
